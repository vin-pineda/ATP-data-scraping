This was my first data scraping project. Naturally, I used Python and imported popular libraries like selenium, BeautifulSoup, and pandas. 
I collected statistics that reflect ATP player statistics from June 2025. I imported the scraped data into a CSV file with columns that included 
the player's name, country, total matches, and other statistics.
